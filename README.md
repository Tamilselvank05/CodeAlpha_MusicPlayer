Description: 
I recently completed a project where the architecture was divided into three main components: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML formed the foundation, defining the structure and content of the page. CSS was used to style the elements laid out in the HTML file. JavaScript added functionality, including features like audio elements, player buttons, and music information. It also enhanced interactivity by responding to user actions such as clicks.
